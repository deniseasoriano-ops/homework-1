Amika prepared our subs and those were delicious!
I wish I could try Jerk Turkey sub though but this Publix was out of that meat! 
Amika was professional and neat! And the customer service counter had two cashiers to take care of customers!
Thank you and we will be definitely back!","157","0"

The variety they offer is mind blowing. The pub subs will blow any sub joint out of the water. Great selection of produce and meats.
Store is always clean, fully staffed, and shelves stocked. My go to grocery store.","390","1"

The store is always clean and bright, inside and out with helpful, friendly service. They have a deli counter with famous pub subs and hot bar options as well as sushi & ramen that you can take home or go upstairs to their dining area. The store is well stocked with plenty of options and bogos! Love my local Publix!","53","1"

After 2 years at the ""Walgreens""pharmacy across the street being one nightmare after the next. I could not be more grateful for the Publix Pharmacy staff at this Yellow Bluff location. Well done hiring responsible and committed pharmacists and employees to provide quality and effective service to the community. They are timely and reliable. They go above and beyond. Thank you !","48","0"

Getting a sub is very convenient since it's right in the front of the store, no need to even walk around and look for the sub station. I was able to get a sub for lunch and eat it at the nearby Sheffield Regional Park.","1871","3"

We stumbled across this Publix grand opening today. We really enjoyed the nice store and deals! I love the upstairs dining with the option to eat inside or outside. Brand new store. I retired from Publix in 1993. I should of never left. This is the best grocery chain ever. They take great care of their customers. No doubt.","1917","18"
"1758921996-8","https://www.yelp.com/biz/publix-jacksonville-19?osq=publix","Samuel C.","Nov 24, 2021","5 star rating","Great location they just opened up, very big store they have a second floor where you can eat food or take a break seeing that they have couches up there too. 

They have a subway style station for the famous publix subs, They also have hot fried food like chicken and potato wedges stuff like that.

I specifically went there because they have ramen available, also different types of rice bowls and poke bowls.

I've already been there twice the ramen I thought was a little too salty I'm going to give it a go another time. But the rice bowl I got was a Asian barbecue and it was delicious. Also if you go on a Wednesday sushi is $5 a carton

I would totally recommend it, food was delicious I would not recommend coming at lunch maybe like before and/or a little after lunch because the first time I came I waited a good maybe 15 minutes in line. The second time I came it was before noon and there was no wait.","74","2"

The ramen and pok√© bowl station was what really caught my eye, and the ramen in particular has me hooked. I am crossing my fingers for more variety in the future, but what they have now is great. I hope they continue to make more Publix locations like this one.","6","0"
