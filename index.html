                <h3>O_ G.</h3> <p><em>Apr 19, 2025</em></p> <p><strong>★★★★★ 5.0</strong></p> <p>"New Publix with large upstairs dining area, you can even sit outside on a balcony!
                Amika prepared our subs and those were delicious!
                I wish I could try Jerk Turkey sub though but this Publix was out of that meat!
                Amika was professional and neat! And the customer service counter had two cashiers to take care of customers!
                Thank you and we will be definitely back!"</p>

                The variety they offer is mind blowing. The pub subs will blow any sub joint out of the water. Great selection of produce and meats.
                Store is always clean, fully staffed, and shelves stocked. My go to grocery store."</p>

The store is always clean and bright, inside and out with helpful, friendly service. They have a deli counter with famous pub subs and hot bar options as well as sushi & ramen that you can take home or go upstairs to their dining area. The store is well stocked with plenty of options and bogos! Love my local Publix!"</p>

After 2 years at the "Walgreens"pharmacy across the street being one nightmare after the next. I could not be more grateful for the Publix Pharmacy staff at this Yellow Bluff location. Well done hiring responsible and committed pharmacists and employees to provide quality and effective service to the community. They are timely and reliable. They go above and beyond. Thank you !"</p>
