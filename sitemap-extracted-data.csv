Plenty of cheese and meat.
You can put a plethora of toppings .
You can watch them putting it together.
Their staff is always smiling.
They  always are  cordial.
You can order ahead of time.  
By ordering ahead, you can have it ready for you when you arrive .This a is a major help because the lines become long especially around meal times.
Price: great value for their subs.
Publix has the best subs.","9","0"

My Our first stop was the deli to get Canoli (of you know you know) and the two employees were so deep into their convo that they didnt acknowledge the customers standing there! They were loud and the convo was rather ignorant for work!! The next stop was the seafood counter!! We walked up talking and stood there a few minutes before I screamed hell9 how are you to the employees standing in front of us looking down at the table (most likely his phone)!! I don't get this new generation of workers because they all want money but come to work with the nastiest attitudes!! I've never had a problem with that store until today. Very very disappointed in Publix","24","0"

But this is the smallest Publix I have been to with a small parking lot. Good luck finding parking during rush hour at 5 PM on a Friday. Even when I stop by at 7 AM, there is already quite a few cars. The store employee aren't as friendly either compared to other Publix. But unfortunately, I don't have much of a choice given this is the one closest to me.","339","1"

One of the only grocery stores close to the Downtown Jacksonville Area. Horrible parking situation. I recommend walking if you could. They accept EBT and have a coin star machine. I normally go to the one on Normandy. Go during the day, it can be a bit scary at night. Hence the security guard outside.","142","6"

Wry young lady 

The setup around that area as well needs a little rethinking.  There is no where to stand besides an aisle so everyone cuts in line on the other side. Maybe add another person... waiting 30 minutes for a sandwich is ridiculous with only a few people in line. Left after 20 minutes when no one acknowledged me standing there making eye contact waving my hands around basically (jk), I was cut in line and then I watched the slowest sandwich of all time being made. No offense, but I just remember the good old days of Publix and having this be the first one I've visited in 10 years made me really sad. Back to King Soopers!","","1"

I bought a bottle of wine & the same wine from Publix on Roosevelt earlier today.  The stores are just 5 miles away.  For exactly the same wine, the difference was $10.  When we went to customer service we waited 15 minutes.  No one at the store could explain why.  Though they were nice about it, the message was 'it is what it is'.  Publix you truly disappointed me tonight.","","3"

Parking lot is an absolute disaster (be ready to fight someone for a spot) and they don't even stock all the normal items because it's a smaller-scale store. What inspired my review today though was the pharmacy. I have used this location for their pharmacy services a few times and the last couple visits I thought I was just catching them on a bad day/at a bad time! Unfortunately it just seems to me like they're always in a big mess back there... 

Staff gives me a different excuse for the elongated wait times every visit so who knows what's really going on. Most recently they quoted me over an hour and a half wait and asked me to come back. So I left the store and as soon as I got out of the parking lot I received a text that my prescription was ready. I was very annoyed! Had to turn right back around and fight parking to go inside again.

Will be filling elsewhere from now on because who has time to play games with a pharmacy at 7pm on a weeknight? Not me.","217","5"

Even though their products are not as fresh and they always run out of things that I want to purchase the employees that works here makes a difference! They are very professional and accommodating with their customers and that win me over for giving them 5 stars. Working in public is hard and employees here always give 100% attention to the customers and I applaud them for that! Hopefully they can continue what they're doing and will not stop for the excellent customer service I have been receiving.","","8"

Unfortunately, this Publix was really small, it had a very limited selection and A LOT of food expired this week when normally it would be good 6+months on the shelf. Lastly, I noticed that the majority of customers were non-white... so it's like this particular Publix just did the bare minimum if you compare it to the one I went to in Julington Creek yesterday. So that was disheartening.","2","0"

This is exactly what the Riverside area needed desperately. I stop in here when I am passing through the hood. I told the Manager about too many buggies in the lot blocking parking spots. When I came back out after shopping, all of the buggies were put away and more cars had spaces to park. Publix is a ""WOW"" company. 
 I know because I retired from Publix. Great store, Management, employees, prices and freshness of the produce department. If they don't have what you are looking for, ask a Manager to order what you need and they will.","","14"
